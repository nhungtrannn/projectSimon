As a player, I am presented with four colored buttons that light up in a specific pattern. 

After displaying the pattern, I must repeat the pattern by clicking the buttons in proper order. 

Each time I complete the pattern correctly, I see the same pattern of buttons light up faster and with an additional step . 

I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when I am presented with the pattern and when I press the buttons. 

If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and the button patterns starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again. 

I can see how many steps are in the current pattern. 

If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step. 

I can play in strict mode where if I press the wrong button, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of patterns.

I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of victory, then the game starts over. 



pseudocode


when the player clicks on start, the computer will light up the first color

if the player clicks the right color, the computer will display the first color and then second color

if the player clicks the wrong color, the computer will notify you that you've done so
